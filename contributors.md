Click the "Fork" button on the top right corner of the repository's page on GitHub. This will create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

### 2. Create a Branch

Clone your forked repository to your local machine, then create a new branch for your contribution. Name your branch in a descriptive manner that reflects the purpose of your contribution.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-nocodb.git
cd python-nocodb
git checkout -b feature/your-feature

### 3. Work on Your Contribution

Now you can start working on your contribution. Be sure to follow the coding guidelines (mentioned below) and implement your changes or new features.

### 4. Test Your Code

Thoroughly test your code to ensure it works as expected. Make sure to write unit tests, if applicable. Your contribution should not introduce new bugs or regressions.
